This is the admin dashboard to the restaurant web application project.

Admins can create and/or login their accounts.

After logging in, they can modify the price, name or picture of items in the restaurant menu list.

During each item modification, the server sends an SQL query to the database to update the selected item.


Start the server by running the command 'node server.js' then open localhost:8888 in the web browser.
